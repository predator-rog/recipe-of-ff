                                        French fries
                 First, grab 1 extra-large potato, 2 large potatoes or 3 medium potatoes equalling about 315 grams. Rinse well in water and then peel the potato.

TIP: Peeling the potato is optional. While I know some people like the skin on their french fries, I find that it creates a tough exterior. I personally prefer my finger chips to be bare and tender.Now slice the potato in slices having 1 cm thickness. Before slicing, you can remove the top and bottom part of the potato to get a square or rectangle shaped potato.

TIP: If you are planning on making french fries at home often, there is actually a device called a french fry cutter that will do steps 2-4 for you! That said, I don’t have space in my kitchen for a tool that only achieves one end. Using a knife and cutting board takes a few extra minutes, but isn’t difficult
Rinse these potato sticks for a couple of times in water. Add the rinsed potatoes to a bowl and submerge them in cold water for 30-45 minutes to remove extra starch.   

TIP: In a hot and humid climate, keep the bowl in the fridge. For extra crispy fries, soak potatoes in salt water instead.
After 30 minutes or 45 minute
s, drain the potatoes in a colander.                       Then place them on a clean kitchen cotton napkin
Fold the napkin over to press, pat and dry the potatoes. The potatoes have to be completely dried before you begin to fry them.
Heat oil in a wok or pan over medium or medium-low heat, depending on the heaviness of your pan
For a heavy pan or wok, keep medium flame and for a less heavy pan, use a medium-low flame. The oil should reach a temperature of 130 to 135 degrees celsius (275 degrees Fahrenheit)
Now, working in batches, add the potatoes to the oil. Do not overcrowd the wok (kadai) or pan. The oil will sizzle and bubble less when you fry the potatoes at this temperature.
Stir in intervals while frying them for uniform cooking
Fry/blanch in oil for about 3 minutes or until the potatoes are cooked, but not brown from outside.

They should just get a crust from outside without any major color change. Light browning of the edges is fine. Remove with a slotted spoon.
Place the half fried potatoes on paper kitchen towels. Stack 3 to 4 paper towels. Press some paper towels from top also to absorb extra oil. Let the half fried potatoes cool down at room temperature.

Note: After removing this batch, you can fry the second batch of potatoes. By the time you fry the second batch of the potatoes, the first batch will cool down enough for the second fry. So even though you have to fry twice, you’re using the same batch of oil all the way through!
Now increase the flame to a medium-high or high. Again here for a heavy pan, use a high flame and for a less heavy pan, use a medium-high flame. The oil should be have a temperature of 180 to 185 degrees Celsius 
Add the first batch of once-fried potatoes to the hot oil. The oil will sizzle and bubble quickly and as soon as you add the potatoes.  
 Stir often while the potatoes fry to cook them evenly
    Fry french fries for 3 minutes or until crisp and golden. The edges should become golden.
    Place french fries on paper tissues again to remove the extra oil.
     While still hot, take the french fries in a bowl. Sprinkle with some salt, paprika or red chili flakes, dried herbs or dry rosemary. You can add your favorite herbs and spices
